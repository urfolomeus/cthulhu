use Mix.Config

# It is possible to import configuration files, relative to this directory.
# For example, you can emulate configuration per environment by uncommenting
# the line below and defining dev.exs, test.exs and such.
#
# Configuration from the imported file will override the ones defined
# here (which is why it is important to import them last).
#
#     import_config "#{Mix.env}.exs"
